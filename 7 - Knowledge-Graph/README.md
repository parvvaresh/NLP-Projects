# Knowledge Graph
Knowledge graph is one of the valuable tools in data science and it is possible to obtain a general visualization of the data
A knowledge graph can be created by using the subject and the object in the sentences and the main verb in the sentence.
Note that sentences must be extracted that have exactly one subject and one object.

for example :

The new relationships can emerge not only from the first node but from any node in a knowledge graph as shown below and A node or an entity can have multiple relations as well.

We have 2 basic problems:
1. Compound subjects and objects
2. Find the main verb of the sentence

in example folder we have use sentences of wikipedia and see result : 

## for all relation :

## for "composed by" relation :

## for "released in" relation :
