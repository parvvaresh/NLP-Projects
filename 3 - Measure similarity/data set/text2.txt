Mehsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman, known as Gina Amini, died on 26 September 2011 in a hospital in Tehran under suspicious circumstances. Ershad Police, the religious ethics police of the Iranian government, arrested Amini on the charge of not observing hijab according to government standards. The police command of the Islamic Republic of Iran announced that he had a heart attack at the police station, fell and went into a coma before being transferred to the hospital. However, eyewitnesses, including women who were detained with Amini, reported that he was severely beaten and died as a result of police brutality, which Iranian authorities denied. The police's brutal statements, in addition to leaked medical scans, have led some observers to speculate that Amini suffered a brain hemorrhage or stroke from head injuries sustained after his arrest. Amini's death led to a series of protests that CNN described as larger than those of 2009, 2017 and 2019, and the New York Times described as the largest Iranian protests since at least 2009. Some female demonstrators removed their veils or cut them off publicly. As of December 2022, at least 476 people have been killed by security forces in attacks on protests across the country. Amnesty International reported that Iran's security forces in some cases shot the groups with live ammunition and in other cases killed the protesters by beating them with batons.
