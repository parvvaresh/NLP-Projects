## 1. News Classification

- **Description**: This project aims to classify news articles into different categories using NLP techniques. It involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning classification algorithms.
  
- **Files**:
  - `fars_news_v1.2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for news classification.
  - `test.txt`: Sample test data for the classification.

## 2. Auto Correct

- **Description**: Implementation of an auto-correct system using NLP algorithms. The system corrects spelling mistakes in text input by suggesting the most probable corrections based on context and language models.
  
- **Files**:
  - `main.py`: Main script for the auto-correct system.
  - `model/`: Directory containing modules for edit distance calculation, Jaccard similarity, and pre-processing.
  - `words_en.csv`: English word dataset.
  - `words_fa.csv`: Persian (Farsi) word dataset.

## 3. Measure Similarity

- **Description**: A project to measure the similarity between two texts. It involves calculating various similarity metrics such as cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, or edit distance.
  
- **Files**:
  - `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code for measuring text similarity.
  - `data set/`: Directory containing sample text files for similarity measurement.

## 4. Text Summarization

- **Description**: Implementation of text summarization techniques using NLP. The project aims to generate concise summaries of large text documents or articles while preserving the key information.
  
- **Files**:
  - `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for text summarization.

## 5. Email Spam Detection

- **Description**: Detecting spam emails using various machine learning algorithms and NLP features. The project involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
  
- **Files**:
  - `src/`: Directory containing scripts for pre-processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
  - `README.md`: Details about the project and its implementation.

## 6. Resume Classification

- **Description**: Classifying resumes into different categories based on their content. It involves extracting relevant information from resumes and using machine learning algorithms for classification.
  
- **Files**:
  - `resume_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for resume classification.
  - `resume_dataset.csv`: Dataset containing resume samples.

## 7. Knowledge Graph

- **Description**: Building a knowledge graph from text data. The project involves extracting entities and relationships from unstructured text and representing them in a structured graph format.
  
- **Files**:
  - `example/`: Directory containing example data and scripts for building the knowledge graph.
  - `src/`: Directory containing scripts for extracting details, processing data, and building the knowledge graph.
  - `README.md`: Information about the project and how to use it.

Feel free to explore each project folder for more details and instructions on how to run the code.
